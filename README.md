#mount-ms

[kaibra/mount-ms "0.0.1"]

This project is derived from tesla-microservice.
Main differences to the tesla-microservice:
    - mount-ms uses MOUNT instead of component (surprise) :)

Current available components are:
    - ms-httpkit

To see a working example of this microservice which includes a server look at 'kaibra/ms-example'.
